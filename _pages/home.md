I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student with <a href="http://neutron.manoonpong.com/" target="_blank">NEUTRON Laboratory</a> at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) advised by Prof. <a href="http://manoonpong.com/" target="_blank">Poramate Manoonpong</a>  

My area of interests are Machine (Reinforcement) learning for robotics, Mobile robot, Bioinspired robot, and the high-level cognitive robotics which provide the robot more intelligent. My goal is to bring the robot out of the lab into the real world and make it really work in the wild. I earned M.Eng. in Robotics and Automation from Institute of Field Robotics (FIBO), King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Thailand. I also hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Communication Engineering from Mahidol University, Thailand.

My master thesis is “An Artificial Hormone System for Adaptable Locomotion in a Sea Turtle-Inspired Robot” that proposes using an artificial hormone system as a mechanism which responds to external environmental changes and alters a sea-turtle inspired robot behaviours to move with energy efficiency, supervised by Dr. <a href="http://fibo.kmutt.ac.th/fibo/dr-pitiwut/" target="_blank">Pitiwut Teerakittikul</a> and also got the help from peoples in his laboratory <a href="http://fibo.kmutt.ac.th/fibo/research/fibo-laboratory/bear-lab/" target="_blank">Bio-Inspired & Educational Robotics Lab</a>.
