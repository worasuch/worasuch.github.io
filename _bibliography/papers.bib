  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={There are various challenges to operate autonomous robots for a long time in outdoor real-world environments. One of the most challenging tasks is to reduce the cost of transport when locomoting over hard ground or uneven complex terrain. This paper proposes using an artificial hormone system as a mechanism which responds to external environmental changes and alters robot behaviours to move with energy efficiency. Specifically, hormone systems are used to help the robot deals with terrain variations. The emergence of adaptive locomotion focuses especially on the cost of transport usage. The proposed system is tested in real sea turtle-inspired robot and environment. The results have shown that the robot can adapt its gait and demonstrate robust locomotion which associates with reducing the cost of transport while traveling in complex environments.},

  abstract={Low gravity is one of the most challenging considerations when designing robots for space exploration. Owing to the changing gravitational forces, the locomotion performance of a legged robot tends to decrease when gravity decreases. Recently, quadrupedal robots have been increasingly promoted for space exploration. Most existing studies have mainly developed robot locomotion with an erect posture and have focused on the use of leg functionality. However, to date, robot locomotion with a sprawling posture and a flexible spine has not been fully investigated. Therefore, herein we present a robot with a sprawling posture and flexible spine inspired by geckos for low-gravity locomotion enhancement. The gecko-inspired robot was constructed with a 3-DOF spine and 4-DOF legs. The movement of the robot was controlled using a central pattern generator (CPG). Physical simulations were performed under the gravitational conditions of Earth, Mar, and the Moon. The experimental results show that, owing to the lateral bending movement of the flexible spine with a C-shaped standing wave pattern, the locomotion speed of the robot is increased by 100% relative to that of a traditional fixed-spine robot under each gravity condition. Based on these results, a sprawling-type quadruped robot with a flexible spine will facilitate future studies on robot space exploration under low-gravity conditions.},
